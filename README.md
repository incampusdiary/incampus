# Incampus Diary

It is a social media app specially made for college students.
This app will connect multiple campuses, acting like a social media community solely for students.

College students will find everything related to their college life on this app. It will provide a platform to those who has some talent, but are hesitant to express it freely on other public platforms.
They can do so here and gain some confidence by showcasing it to their own collegemates, and then take it to bigger stages.

With random articles, their knowledge about current technologies, and other scientific advancements are automatically up-to-date. They can also learn about those technologies, if interested.

With features like Notes, we will provide notes to all the college students. Students can also sell their own notes and such.
Other educational resources would also be shared so that 3rd tier college students can still take advantages of 1st tier colleges.

Vetometer can be used to host polls on the platform for organizing functions and other stuff that require opinion or voting.
